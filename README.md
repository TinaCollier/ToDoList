# ToDoList
## A React To Do List 

### What Is It?
This is a To-Do List app that allows the user to add or remove items. It includes a dropdown menu for choosing a day and takes an input for update additional items.

### What Was Challenging?
The base of the program was created as I followed along with my MITxPro professor. He provided us the template for this application. My struggle was adding the dropdown menu. I'm still very new to React and JSX, so I am constantly learning how to improve my code and make it look cleaner.

### What I Would Do To Improve The APP
Next time, I would like to add a DatePicker instead of a dropdown menu. I would also like to include a section for taking notes or adding attachments.

I really enjoyed this activity and look forward to learning more about React and creating applications.
